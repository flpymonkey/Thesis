    "Intuitively, Cover’s UP operates similar to a Fund of\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Its update scheme can be interpreted as a historical performance weighed average of all valid constant rebalanced portfolios,\n",
    "See formula page 9\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that at the beginning of period t + 1, one CRP manager’s wealth (historical performance)\n",

    "Incorporating the initial wealth of S0 = 1, the final cumulative wealth is\n",
    "weighted average of CRP managers’ wealth\n",
    "\n",
    "See formula 3\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Fund of Funds (FOF) is an investment strategy that involves pooling money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of other investment funds, rather than directly in individual securities1\n",
    ". Here are some key points about FOFs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features\n",
    "Diversification: By investing in multiple funds, FOFs offer broad exposure to various asset classes, sectors, and investment strategies2\n",
    ".Professional Management: FOFs are managed by professional fund managers who select and oversee the underlying funds2\n",
    ".Convenience: Investors get a diversified portfolio with a single investment, reducing the need to research and select individual funds2\n",
    ".Additional Fees: FOFs typically charge higher fees due to the layering of management fees from the underlying funds and the FOF itself2\n",
    "\n",
    "Pros and Cons\n",
    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "Risk Reduction: Diversification helps spread risk across different assets and managers3\n",
    "Access to Expertise: Investors gain access to professional fund managers and potentially exclusive funds2\n",
    "Simplicity: Easier for individual investors who may lack the time or expertise to manage multiple investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "Higher Costs: The layered fees can reduce net returns2\n",
    "Complexity: The structure can be more complex, making it harder to understand the full investment landscape.\n",
    "Potential for Over-Diversification: Too much diversification can sometimes dilute potential returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The regret achieved by Cover’s UP is O(mlog n), \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of decision-making and algorithms, regret measures the difference between the actual performance of a strategy and the performance of the best possible strategy in hindsight.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means it is MORE efficient for longer investment horizons.\n",
    "\n",
    "and its time complexity\n",
    "is O (nm), where m denotes the number of stocks and n refers to the number of periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "with suitable smoothness conditions, the average of exponentials grows\n",
    "at the same exponential rate as the maximum, one can asymptotically approach BCRP’s exponential\n",
    "growth rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cover’s Universal Portfolio operates under the assumption of an ideal market model, where assets can be bought and sold without transaction costs, and where information is readily available and market conditions are sufficiently predictable\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While Cover’s Universal Portfolio has strong theoretical foundations and performance guarantees, its practicality in real-world applications is limited by its computational complexity. As the number of assets increases, the time required to compute the optimal portfolio grows exponentially, making it challenging to implement for large portfolios.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, many implementations approximate the ideal by sampling and other methods to keep the computation manageable. It’s a trade-off between theoretical optimality and practical feasibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Cover’s Universal Portfolio (UP). By defining the loss function as the negative logarithmic function of portfolio return, \n",
    "it essentially aligns the problem with an exponentially weighted average forecaster. \n",
    "This makes UP a robust strategy for adaptive portfolio selection because it rewards portfolios that \n",
    "perform well consistently over time, thereby exponentially increasing their weight in future decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A loss function is a mathematical tool used in machine learning and statistics to measure how well a model’s \n",
    "predictions align with the actual outcomes. \n",
    "In essence, it quantifies the \"error\" or \"difference\" between the predicted values and the actual values\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Other examples in non-optimal market:\n",
    "They extended the model to include side information, which can be instantiated experts’ opinions, fundamental\n",
    "data, etc. Blum and Kalai [1999] took account of transaction costs for online portfolio selection and\n",
    "proposed a universal portfolio algorithm to handle the costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Page 9, other research\n",
    "Another research topic is to generalize Cover’s UP with different underlying base expert classes,\n",
    "rather than the CRP strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Akcoglu et al. [2002; 2004]\n",
    "extended Cover’s UP from the parameterized CRP class to a wide class of investment strategies, including\n",
    "trading strategies operating on a single stock and portfolio strategies operating on the whole\n",
